Application: Vehicular Security Systems
1️⃣ Project Title Slide


2️⃣ Problem Statement

Modern vehicular security systems require automated visual monitoring to detect:

    * Suspicious objects near vehicles
    * Wheel tampering
    * Circular traffic signs
    * Cameras or sensors placed near vehicles
    * Parking perimeter threats
    * Manual monitoring is inefficient and error-prone.

👉 A smart automated system is needed.

3️⃣ Project Objective

    * Develop a MATLAB-based system that:
    * Detects circular objects in images
    * Counts detected circles accurately
    * Works under real vehicular conditions
    * Can be extended to real-time camera systems

4️⃣ Why Circle Detection for Vehicular Security?

Many important vehicular elements are circular:
    * Vehicle wheels
    * Traffic signs
    * Headlights
    * Surveillance cameras
    * Suspicious objects (e.g., planted devices)

Circle detection improves:

    * Automated surveillance
    * Parking lot security
    * Smart vehicle monitoring
    * Intrusion detection systems
